      <p>
        I’m Rahul, an aspiring full-stack web developer with a passion for coding and learning.
         I focus on React for front-end development and Spring Boot for building robust backend applications.
         I enjoy creating real-world projects that solve practical problems and help me grow as a developer.
       I’m dedicated to continuous
        growth and stay updated with the latest in web technologies. Outside of coding,
        I’m always exploring new ways to learn and contribute to the developer community.
